# os-profiler

**os-profiler** is a lightweight Node.js utility that provides a snapshot of system resource utilization, including CPU, memory, and disk usage. This package is ideal for profiling system utilization in real-time, enabling you to track resource consumption and ensure that systems are running efficiently.

## Features
- Get CPU usage, including idle and active time.
- Monitor memory usage, including total, used, free memory, and usage percentage.
- Analyze disk utilization, including total, used, and free space on the root directory.

## Installation

You can install this package via npm:

```bash
npm install os-profiler
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use `os-profiler` to retrieve a snapshot of system resource utilization:

```javascript
const { getSystemSnapshot } = require('os-profiler');

(async () => {
  const snapshot = await getSystemSnapshot();
  console.log(snapshot);
})();
```

### Output Example:

```json
{
  "cpu": {
    "cpuCount": 4,
    "idlePercentage": 85.65,
    "totalPercentage": 14.35
  },
  "memory": {
    "total": 17179869184,
    "used": 8376545280,
    "free": 8794213888,
    "usagePercentage": 48.76
  },
  "disk": {
    "total": 499963174912,
    "used": 256789012480,
    "free": 243174162432,
    "usagePercentage": 51.37
  }
}
```

## Method

### `getSystemSnapshot()`

Returns a promise that resolves to an object containing CPU, memory, and disk utilization data.

- **CPU Data:**
  - `cpuCount`: Number of CPU cores.
  - `idlePercentage`: Percentage of time CPU cores are idle.
  - `totalPercentage`: Percentage of CPU usage.

- **Memory Data:**
  - `total`: Total system memory in bytes.
  - `used`: Used memory in bytes.
  - `free`: Free memory in bytes.
  - `usagePercentage`: Memory usage as a percentage.

- **Disk Data:**
  - `total`: Total disk space in bytes.
  - `used`: Used disk space in bytes.
  - `free`: Free disk space in bytes.
  - `usagePercentage`: Disk usage as a percentage.
